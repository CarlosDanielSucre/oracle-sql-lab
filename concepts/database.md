## What is a database? Data vs. Information.

**Database Defined**

**Database** is an organized collection of structure information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.  
A database is usually controlled by a **database management system (DBMS)**. Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the ap-
plications that are associated with them, are referred to as database system, often shortened to just database.  

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables  
to make processing and data queryng efficient. The data can then easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and  
organized. Most databases use **Structure Query Language (SQL)** for weiting and queryng data.

**Data Defined**

**Data** is a collection of facts. numbers, words, observations or other useful information. Through data processing and data a-  
nalysis, organizations transform raw data points into valuable insights that improve decision-making and drive better business  
outcomes.

**Information Defined**  

**Information** is all around us, but what does the word actually mean? Historically, there have been lots of different definiti-  
ons of information. The Oxford English Dictionary defines information as ‘the imparting of knowledge in general’. However, this   
doesn’t actually tell us what information is.

Information is the meaning that we get from this data. So for example, if we had a list of the number of ibises on campus from  
2008 to 2018, our data would be a list of numbers. If we analyse that data, we can draw meaning out of it to create information.  
In this example, we could find out whether the number of ibises was the same, or if it had got larger or smaller.

**Data vs Information.**

Then, we come to the conclusion, **Data** is the isolated facts, while **Information** is the way we interpret that data,  
as stated in the definition above, a clear example is a list of numbers -- on its own, it has no meaning. But with context and pur-  
pose, that data turns into valuable information.
