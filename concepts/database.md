# What is a database? Data vs. Information.

**Database Defined**

**Database** is an organized collection of structure information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.  
A database is usually controlled by a **database management system (DBMS)**. Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the ap-
plications that are associated with them, are referred to as database system, often shortened to just database.  

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables  
to make processing and data queryng efficient. The data can then easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and  
organized. Most databases use **Structure Query Language (SQL)** for weiting and queryng data.
